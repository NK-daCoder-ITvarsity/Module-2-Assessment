                            Elephants eat grasses, leaves, shrubs, fruits and roots depending on 
                            the season and their habitat. When it’s particularly dry, elephants will 
                            eat more woody parts of trees and shrubs like twigs, branches and barks. 
                            They need to eat up to 150kg of food per day – that's around 375 tins of baked beans 
                            – although half of this may leave the body undigested. 
                            Elephants eat so much that they can spend up to three-quarters of their day just eating.

                            Elephants have around 150,000 muscle units in their trunk. 
                            Their trunks are perhaps the most sensitive organ found in any mammal. 
                            Elephants use their trunks to suck up water to drink – it can contain up 
                            to 8 litres of water. They also use their trunks as a snorkel when swimming

                            Elephant tusks are actually enlarged incisor teeth which first appear 
                            when elephants are around 2 years old. Tusks continue growing throughout their lives. 
                            Tusks are used to help with feeding - prising bark off trees or digging up roots - or as 
                            a defense when fighting. But these beautiful tusks often cause elephants danger. They're 
                            made from ivory; a much desired object. Read on to find out why elephants are under threat.

                            An elephant’s skin is 2.5cm thick in most places. 
                            The folds and wrinkles in their skin can retain up to 
                            10 times more water than flat skin does, which helps to cool them down. 
                            They keep their skin clean and protect themselves from sunburn by taking 
                            regular dust and mud baths.

                            Elephants communicate in a variety of ways - including sounds like trumpet calls 
                            (some sounds are too low for people to hear), body language, touch and scent. They 
                            can also communicate through seismic signals - sounds that create vibrations in 
                            the ground - which they may detect through their bones.

                            Amazingly, elephant calves are able to stand within 20 minutes 
                            of being born and can walk within 1 hour. After two days, they 
                            can keep up with the herd. This incredible survival technique means 
                            that herds of elephants can keep migrating to find food and water to thrive.

                            join a female herd when it is mating season, or at a waterhole
